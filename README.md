# Supplementary Files
This repository contains the notebooks(code) and relevant datafiles accompanying the monograph.

## Release Notes
* *V.1.0.0* Code updated to monograph release.

## Requirements
* Code was developed and tested under *Wolfram Mathematica 11.2.0.0* and also tested in *Mathematica 11.3.0.0*

## Instructions
* Download either of the Assets to your computer, and use the notebooks in Mathematica as companions to  the monograph.
* All files are best to be kept in the same folder


## FAQ
### I see a warning regarding compatibility with an older version of Mathematica
* The code has been checked for compatibility with Mathematica 11.2+, so if you are using a compatible version you can safely ignore the warning.
### Some of the results I get from querying the online databases do not match the answers in the notebook
* The databases queried are updated on a regular basis, and the APIs may also be updated. The code should still work, though you may get more up-to-date responses.
### Some of the randomly generated data is different when I run it
* This is expected (unless RandomSeed is set for reporducibility), as it is highly probably you will get different results from the pseudorandom generator that creates the data in these computations
### The UniProt Web API URL used in the notebooks uses https
* The notebooks have been updated for forward compatibility, since as of release 2018_06 (June 20, 2018) UniProt web pages and services will transition from http to https.
